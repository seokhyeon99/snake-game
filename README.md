# snake-game

       Snake game consists of three levels.  
       you get scores if it eat food while moving using the arrow keys, but if it step on the bomb, you lose points.  
       The higher the score, the faster the speed.  
       The game is over if the snake's length is less than 3 or hits the edge of the map or its body.
